# algorit.ma-project

This is repositories for all project that i was worked on when attending algorit.ma data science school bootcamp

Here are list and description project that i created
1. Regression 
   Using boston crime dataset, i'm trying to predict crime_rate based on various variable using linear regression techniques
2. Classification-1
   Using this data, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers
   I'm trying to classify customer segment , is it horeca(hotel, restaurant and cafe) or Retail
   Using logistic regression and K-NN algorithm
3. Classification-2
   Using this data, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)
   I'm trying to predict whether customer will default or not, using Random Forest, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Algorithm
4. Clustering
   Using this data https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata
   I'm trying to cluster customer of credit card and make analysis for cluster result. using K-means+PCA algorithm
5. Time Series
   I'm trying to forecast google stock for Jan 2019 - Jun 2019 using past 10 years data. techniques that are used : SMA, Holt WInters and ARIMA
6. Neural Network
   Using Fashion MNIST Data (The Data is Big, and not uploaded) - https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist
   Based on kaggle : Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
   Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
   I'm trying to classify the image into 10 labels using Neural Network
7. Capstone-DV
   This is all code that used forCapstone Project for Data Visualization. using suicide dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016
   Here's the link for the project:https://ambiyasa.shinyapps.io/DVCapstoneProject2019/
8. Capstone-ML
   This is Capstone Project for Machine Learning. 
   I'm trying to create model for data xxxx, a transpotation online company from xxxx country.
   Model that created is classification model, that used to classify whether total driver in an area will be sufficient or not for servicing customer.
   Variable that are used is area data, and time stamp data
